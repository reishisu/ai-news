<a name="access-analyzer-reference-policy-checks"></a>

You can validate your policies using AWS Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer policy validation. You can create or edit a policy using the AWS CLI, AWS API, or JSON policy editor in the IAM console. IAM Access Analyzer validates your policy against IAM [policy grammar](reference_policies_grammar.md) and [AWS best practices](best-practices.md). You can view policy validation check findings that include security warnings, errors, general warnings, and suggestions for your policy. These findings provide actionable recommendations that help you author policies that are functional and conform to security best practices. The list of basic policy checks provided by IAM Access Analyzer are shared below. There is no additional charge associated with running the policy validation checks. To learn more about validating policies using policy validation, see [Validate policies with IAM Access Analyzer](access-analyzer-policy-validation.md).

## Error – ARN account not allowed
<a name="access-analyzer-reference-policy-checks-error-arn-account-not-allowed"></a>

**Issue code: **ARN\_ACCOUNT\_NOT\_ALLOWED

**Finding type: **ERROR

**Finding details**

In the AWS Management Console, the finding for this check includes the following message:

```
ARN account not allowed: The service {{service}} does not support specifying an account ID in the resource ARN.
```

In programmatic calls to the AWS CLI or AWS API, the finding for this check includes the following message:

```
"findingDetails": "The service {{service}} does not support specifying an account ID in the resource ARN."
```

**Resolving the error**

Remove the account ID from the resource ARN. The resource ARNs for some AWS services do not support specifying an account ID.

For example, Amazon S3 does not support an account ID as a namespace in bucket ARNs. An Amazon S3 bucket name is globally unique, and the namespace is shared by all AWS accounts. To view all of the resource types available in Amazon S3, see [ Resource types defined by Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazons3.html#amazons3-resources-for-iam-policies) in the *Service Authorization Reference*.

## Error – ARN Region not allowed
<a name="access-analyzer-reference-policy-checks-error-arn-region-not-allowed"></a>

**Issue code: **ARN\_REGION\_NOT\_ALLOWED

**Finding type: **ERROR

**Finding details**

In the AWS Management Console, the finding for this check includes the following message:

```
ARN Region not allowed: The service {{service}} does not support specifying a Region in the resource ARN.
```

In programmatic calls to the AWS CLI or AWS API, the finding for this check includes the following message:

```
"findingDetails": "The service {{service}} does not support specifying a Region in the resource ARN."
```

**Resolving the error**

Remove the Region from the resource ARN. The resource ARNs for some AWS services do not support specifying a Region.

For example, IAM is a global service. The Region portion of an IAM resource ARN is always kept blank. IAM resources are global, like an AWS account is today. For example, after you sign in as an IAM user, you can access AWS services in any geographic region.

## Error – Duplicate keys with different case
<a name="access-analyzer-reference-policy-checks-error-duplicate-keys-with-different-case"></a>

**Issue code: **DUPLICATE\_KEYS\_WITH\_DIFFERENT\_CASE

**Finding type: **ERROR

**Finding details**

In the AWS Management Console, the finding for this check includes the following message:

```
Duplicate keys with different case: The condition key {{key}} appears more than once with different capitalization in the same condition block. Remove the duplicate condition keys.
```

In programmatic calls to the AWS CLI or AWS API, the finding for this check includes the following message:

```
"findingDetails": "The condition key {{key}} appears more than once with different capitalization in the same condition block. Remove the duplicate condition keys."
```

**Resolving the error**

Review the similar condition keys within the same condition block and use the same capitalization for all instances.

A *condition block* is the text within the `Condition` element of a policy statement. Condition key *names* are not case-sensitive. The case-sensitivity of condition key *values* depends on the condition operator that you use. For more information about case-sensitivity in condition keys, see [IAM JSON policy elements: Condition](reference_policies_elements_condition.md).

"findingDetails": "Policy variables can only be used with String and ARN operators."
```

**Resolving the error**

You can use policy variables in the `Resource` element and in string comparisons in the `Condition` element. Conditions support variables when you use string operators or ARN operators. String operators include `StringEquals`, `StringLike`, and `StringNotLike`. ARN operators include `ArnEquals` and `ArnLike`. You can't use a policy variable with other operators, such as Numeric, Date, Boolean,  Binary, IP Address, or Null operators.

**Resolving the error**

In the `Condition` element, you build expressions in which you use condition operators like equal or less than to compare a condition in the policy against keys and values in the request context. For requests that include multiple values for a single condition key, you must enclose the conditions within brackets like an array ("Key2":["Value2A", "Value2B"]). You must also use the `ForAllValues` or `ForAnyValue`  set operators with the `StringLike` condition operator. These qualifiers add set-operation functionality to the condition operator so that you can test multiple request values against multiple condition values.

```

In programmatic calls to the AWS CLI or AWS API, the finding for this check includes the following message:

```
"findingDetails": "Duplicate statement IDs are not supported for this policy type. Update the Sid value."
```

**Resolving the error**

For some policy types, statement IDs must be unique. The `Sid` (statement ID) element allows you to enter an optional identifier that you provide for the policy statement. You can assign a statement ID value to each statement in a statement array using the `SID` element. In services that let you specify an ID element, such as SQS and SNS, the `Sid` value is just a sub-ID of the policy document's ID. For example, in IAM, the `Sid` value must be unique within a JSON policy.

```

**Resolving the error**

AWS does not support using the specified global condition key. Depending on your use case, you can use the `aws:PrincipalArn` or `aws:SourceArn` global condition keys. For example, instead of `aws:ARN`, use the `aws:PrincipalArn` to compare the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the principal that made the request with the ARN that you specify in the policy. Alternatively, use the `aws:SourceArn` global condition key to compare the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource making a service-to-service request with the ARN that you specify in the policy.

**Resolving the error**

The `Principal` element specifies the principal that is allowed or denied access to a resource. You cannot use the `Principal` element in an IAM identity-based policy. You can use it in the trust policies for IAM roles and in resource-based policies. Resource-based policies are policies that you embed directly in a resource. For example, you can embed policies in an Amazon S3 bucket or an AWS KMS key.

In programmatic calls to the AWS CLI or AWS API, the finding for this check includes the following message:

```
"findingDetails": "Wildcards (*, ?) are not supported with the principal key {{principal_key}}. Replace the wildcard with a valid principal value."
```

**Resolving the error**

The `Principal` element structure supports using a key-value pair. The principal value specified in the policy includes a wildcard (\*). You can't include a wildcard with the principal key that you specified. For example, when you specify users in a `Principal` element, you cannot use a wildcard to mean "all users". You must name a specific user or users. Similarly, when you specify an assumed-role session, you cannot use a wildcard to mean "all sessions". You must name a specific session. You also cannot use a wildcard to match part of a name or an ARN.

To resolve this finding, remove the wildcard and provide a more specific principal.

In programmatic calls to the AWS CLI or AWS API, the finding for this check includes the following message:

```
"findingDetails": "The policy variable default value must begin and end with a single quote. Add the missing quote."
```

**Resolving the error**

When you add a variable to your policy, you can specify a default value for the variable. If a variable is not present, AWS uses the default text that you provide.

To add a default value to a variable, surround the default value with single quotes (`' '`), and separate the variable text and the default value with a comma and space (`, `).

For example, if a principal is tagged with `team=yellow`, they can access the `amzn-s3-demo-bucket` Amazon S3 bucket with the name `amzn-s3-demo-bucket-yellow`. A policy with this resource might allow team members to access their own resources, but not those of other teams. For users without team tags, you might set a default value of `company-wide`. These users can access only the `amzn-s3-demo-bucket-company-wide` bucket where they can view broad information, such as instructions for joining a team.

## Error – Variable unsupported in version
<a name="access-analyzer-reference-policy-checks-error-variable-unsupported-in-version"></a>

**Issue code: **VARIABLE\_UNSUPPORTED\_IN\_VERSION

**Finding type: **ERROR

**Finding details**

In the AWS Management Console, the finding for this check includes the following message:

```
Variable unsupported in version: To include variables in your policy, use the policy version 2012-10-17 or later.
```

In programmatic calls to the AWS CLI or AWS API, the finding for this check includes the following message:

```
"findingDetails": "To include variables in your policy, use the policy version 2012-10-17 or later."
```

**Resolving the error**

To use policy variables, you must include the `Version` element and set it to a version that supports policy variables. Variables were introduced in version `2012-10-17`. Earlier versions of the policy language don't support policy variables. If you don't set the `Version` to `2012-10-17` or later, variables like `${aws:username}` are treated as literal strings in the policy.

A `Version` policy element is different from a policy version. The `Version` policy element is used within a policy and defines the version of the policy language. A policy version, is created when you change a customer managed policy in IAM. The changed policy doesn't overwrite the existing policy. Instead, IAM creates a new version of the managed policy.

```
"findingDetails": "The {{policySize}} characters in the service control policy (SCP) exceed the {{policySizeQuota}} character maximum for SCPs. We recommend that you use multiple granular policies."
```

**Resolving the error**

AWS Organizations service control policies (SCPs) support specifying values in the `Action` or `NotAction` elements. However, these values can include wildcards (\*) only at the end of the string. This means that you can specify `iam:Get*` but not `iam:*role`.

To specify multiple actions, AWS recommends that you list them individually.

**Issue code: **INVALID\_SERVICE\_PRINCIPAL\_FORMAT

**Finding type: **ERROR

**Finding details**

In the AWS Management Console, the finding for this check includes the following message:

```

```

In programmatic calls to the AWS CLI or AWS API, the finding for this check includes the following message:

```
"findingDetails": "The service principal does not match the expected format. Use the format {{expectedFormat}}."
```

**Resolving the error**

The value in the condition key-value pair must match a defined service principal format.

A *service principal* is an identifier that is used to grant permissions to a service. You can specify a service principal in the `Principal` element or as a value for some global condition keys and service-specific keys. The service principal is defined by each service.

The identifier for a service principal includes the service name, and is usually in the following format in all lowercase letters:

`{{service-name}}.amazonaws.com`

Some service-specific keys may use a different format for service principals. For example, the `kms:ViaService` condition key requires the following format for service principals in all lowercase letters:

`{{service-name.AWS_region}}.amazonaws.com`

```
"findingDetails": "The condition key {{conditionKeyName}} must include a tag key to control access based on tags. Use the format {{conditionKeyName}}tag-key and specify a key name for tag-key."
```

**Resolving the error**

To control access based on tags, you provide tag information in the [condition element](reference_policies_elements_condition.md) of a policy.

For example, to [control access to AWS resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html#access_tags_control-resources), you include the `aws:ResourceTag` condition key. This key requires the format `aws:ResourceTag/{{tag-key}}`. To specify the tag key `owner` and the tag value `JaneDoe` in a condition, use the following format.

```
"Condition": {
    "StringEquals": {"aws:ResourceTag/owner": "JaneDoe"}
}

```

```
"findingDetails": "Overly permissive use of policy variable with aws:userID. Use the policy variable on the right side of colon or as the only character on the left side of a colon."
```

**Resolving the error**

There are three possible finding messages for this error.
+ For the first error message, modify your policy variable usage to be more specific. Add at least 6 consecutive characters before the policy variable to reduce the scope of permissions. For example, instead of using `${aws:username}`, use `prefix-${aws:username}` or `myapp-${aws:username}`. This ensures that the policy variable doesn't grant overly broad access.
+ For the second error message, remove the policy variable from the specified condition key. Policy variables can act as effective wildcards and are not permitted with sensitive condition keys for security reasons. Instead, use specific static values or consider restructuring your policy to use non-sensitive condition keys that support policy variables.
+ For the third error message, modify your `aws:userID` policy variable usage to be more restrictive. Place the policy variable on the right side of a colon (after the account ID) or use it as the only character on the left side of a colon. For example, use `AIDACKCEVSQ6C2EXAMPLE:${aws:userid}` or `${aws:userid}:*` instead of `${aws:userid}`.

```
"findingDetails": "Overly permissive use of wildcard with aws:userID. Use the wildcard on the right side of colon or as the only character on the left side of a colon."
```

**Resolving the error**

There are three possible finding messages for this error.
+ For the first error message, make your wildcard usage more specific by adding at least 6 consecutive characters before the wildcard. For example, instead of using `*`, use `prefix-*` or `prefix-*-suffix`. This reduces the scope of the condition and follows the principle of least privilege.
+ For the second error message, remove the wildcard from the specified condition key. Wildcards are not permitted with sensitive condition keys for security reasons. Replace the wildcard with specific values that match your intended access pattern, or consider using a different, non-sensitive condition key that supports wildcards.
+ For the third error message, modify your `aws:userID` wildcard usage to be more restrictive. Place the wildcard on the right side of a colon (after the account ID) or use it as the only character on the left side of a colon. For example, use `AIDACKCEVSQ6C2EXAMPLE:*` or `*:*` instead of `*`.

## General Warning – Wildcard without like operator
<a name="access-analyzer-reference-policy-checks-general-warning-wildcard-without-like-operator"></a>

**Issue code: **WILDCARD\_WITHOUT\_LIKE\_OPERATOR

**Finding type: **GENERAL\_WARNING

**Finding details**

In the AWS Management Console, the finding for this check includes the following message:

```
Wildcard without like operator: Your condition value includes a * or ? character. If you meant to use a wildcard (*, ?), update the condition operator to include Like.
```

In programmatic calls to the AWS CLI or AWS API, the finding for this check includes the following message:

```
"findingDetails": "Your condition value includes a * or ? character. If you meant to use a wildcard (*, ?), update the condition operator to include Like."
```

**Resolving the general warning**

The `Condition` element structure requires that you use a condition operator and a key-value pair. When you specify a condition value that uses a wildcard (\*, ?), you must use the `Like` version of the condition operator. For example, instead of the `StringEquals` string condition operator, use `StringLike`.

**Issue code: **POLICY\_SIZE\_EXCEEDS\_IDENTITY\_POLICY\_QUOTA

**Finding type: **GENERAL\_WARNING

**Finding details**

In the AWS Management Console, the finding for this check includes the following message:

```
Policy size exceeds identity policy quota: The {{policySize}} characters in the identity policy, excluding whitespace, exceed the {{policySizeQuota}} character maximum for inline and managed policies. We recommend that you use multiple granular policies.

In programmatic calls to the AWS CLI or AWS API, the finding for this check includes the following message:

```
"findingDetails": "The {{policySize}} characters in the identity policy, excluding whitespace, exceed the {{policySizeQuota}} character maximum for inline and managed policies. We recommend that you use multiple granular policies."
```

**Resolving the general warning**

You can attach up to 20 managed policies to an IAM identity (user, group of users, or role). However, the size of each managed policy cannot exceed the default quota of 6,144 characters. IAM does not count white space when calculating the size of a policy against this quota. Quotas, also referred to as limits in AWS, are the maximum values for the resources, actions, and items in your AWS account.

Additionally, you can add as many inline policies as you want to an IAM identity. However, the sum size of all inline policies per identity cannot exceed the specified quota.

If your policy is larger than the quota, you can organize your policy into multiple statements and group the statements into multiple policies.

**Resolving the general warning**

Resource-based policies are JSON policy documents that you attach to a resource, such as an Amazon S3 bucket. These policies grant the specified principal permission to perform specific actions on that resource and define under what conditions this applies. The size of resource-based policies cannot exceed the quota set for that resource. Quotas, also referred to as limits in AWS, are the maximum values for the resources, actions, and items in your AWS account.

If your policy is larger than the quota, you can organize your policy into multiple statements and group the statements into multiple policies.

```

**Resolving the general warning**

If you use GitHub as an OIDC IdP, best practice is to limit the entities that can assume the role associated with the IAM IdP. When you include a `Condition` statement in a role trust policy, you can limit the role to a specific GitHub organization, repository, or branch. You can use the condition key `token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub` to limit access. We recommend that you limit the condition to a specific set of repositories or branches. If you use a wildcard (`*`) in `token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub`, then GitHub Actions from organizations or repositories outside of your control are able to assume roles associated with the GitHub IAM IdP in your AWS account.

Specify the repository in `token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub`. You can specify the branch in that same value, or in a separate `token.actions.githubusercontent.com:ref` condition key. When the subject claim does not include the branch — for example, when it names a GitHub environment — specify the branch in `token.actions.githubusercontent.com:ref`.

**Resolving the security warning**

AWS recommends that you use the `ForAllValues` only with multivalued conditions. The `ForAllValues` set operator tests whether the value of every member of the request set is a subset of the condition key set. The condition returns true if every key value in the request matches at least one value in the policy. It also returns true if there are no keys in the request, or if the key values resolve to a null data set, such as an empty string.

To learn whether a condition supports a single value or multiple values, review the [Actions, resources, and condition keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.html) page for the service. Condition keys with the `ArrayOf` data type prefix are multivalued condition keys. For example, Amazon SES supports keys with single values (`String`) and the `ArrayOfString` multivalued data type.

```
Pass role with NotAction and NotResource: Using NotAction with NotResource can be overly permissive because it can allow iam:PassRole permissions on multiple resources.. We recommend that you specify resource ARNs instead.
```

In programmatic calls to the AWS CLI or AWS API, the finding for this check includes the following message:

```
"findingDetails": "Using NotAction with NotResource can be overly permissive because it can allow iam:PassRole permissions on multiple resources.. We recommend that you specify resource ARNs instead."
```

**Resolving the security warning**

To configure many AWS services, you must pass an IAM role to the service. To allow this you must grant the `iam:PassRole` permission to an identity (user, group of users, or role). Using the `NotAction` element and listing some resources in the `NotResource` element can allow your principals to access more services or features than you intended. AWS recommends that you specify allowed ARNs in the `Resource` element instead. Additionally, you can reduce permissions to a single service by using the `iam:PassedToService` condition key.

**Resolving the security warning**

To configure many AWS services, you must pass an IAM role to the service. To allow this you must grant the `iam:PassRole` permission to an identity (user, group of users, or role). Policies that allow `iam:PassRole` and that include a wildcard (\*) in the `Resource` element can allow your principals to access more services or features than you intended. AWS recommends that you specify allowed ARNs in the `Resource` element instead. Additionally, you can reduce permissions to a single service by using the `iam:PassedToService` condition key.

Some AWS services include their service namespace in the name of their role. This policy check takes these conventions into account while analyzing the policy to generate findings. For example, the following resource ARN might not generate a finding:

**Finding details**

In the AWS Management Console, the finding for this check includes the following message:

```

```

**Resolving the security warning**

Some condition keys are more secure when paired with other related condition keys. AWS recommends that you include the related condition keys in the same condition block as the existing condition key. This makes the permissions granted through the policy more secure.

For example, you can use the `aws:VpcSourceIp` condition key to compare the IP address from which a request was made with the IP address that you specify in the policy. AWS recommends that you add the related `aws:SourceVPC` condition key. This checks whether the request comes from the VPC that you specify in the policy *and* the IP address that you specify.

## Security Warning – Deny with unsupported tag condition key for service
<a name="access-analyzer-reference-policy-checks-security-warning-deny-with-unsupported-tag-condition-key-for-service"></a>

**Issue code: **DENY\_WITH\_UNSUPPORTED\_TAG\_CONDITION\_KEY\_FOR\_SERVICE

**Finding type: **SECURITY\_WARNING

**Finding details**

In the AWS Management Console, the finding for this check includes the following message:

```
Deny with unsupported tag condition key for service: Using the effect Deny with the tag condition key {{conditionKeyName}} and actions for services with the following prefixes can be overly permissive: {{serviceNames}}. Actions for the listed services are not denied by this statement. We recommend that you move these actions to a different statement without this condition key.
```

In programmatic calls to the AWS CLI or AWS API, the finding for this check includes the following message:

```
"findingDetails": "Using the effect Deny with the tag condition key {{conditionKeyName}} and actions for services with the following prefixes can be overly permissive: {{serviceNames}}. Actions for the listed services are not denied by this statement. We recommend that you move these actions to a different statement without this condition key."
```

**Resolving the security warning**

Using unsupported tag condition keys in the `Condition` element of a policy with `"Effect": "Deny"` can be overly permissive, because the condition is ignored for that service. AWS recommends that you remove the service actions that don’t support the condition key and create another statement to deny access to specific resources for those actions.

If you use the `aws:ResourceTag` condition key and it’s not supported by a service action, then the key is not included in the request context. In this case, the condition in the `Deny` statement always returns `false` and the action is never denied. This happens even if the resource is tagged correctly.

When a service supports the `aws:ResourceTag` condition key, you can use tags to control access to that service’s resources. This is known as [attribute-based access control (ABAC)](introduction_attribute-based-access-control.md). Services that don’t support these keys require you to control access to resources using [resource-based access control (RBAC)](introduction_attribute-based-access-control.md#introduction_attribute-based-access-control_compare-rbac).

**Note**  
Some services allow support for the `aws:ResourceTag` condition key for a subset of their resources and actions. IAM Access Analyzer returns findings for the service actions that are not supported. For example, Amazon S3 supports `aws:ResourceTag` for a subset of its resources. To view all of the resource types available in Amazon S3 that support the `aws:ResourceTag` condition key, see [Resource types defined by Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazons3.html#amazons3-resources-for-iam-policies) in the Service Authorization Reference.

For example, assume that you want to deny access to untag delete specific resources that are tagged with the key-value pair `status=Confidential`. Also assume that AWS Lambda allows you to tag and untag resources, but doesn’t support the `aws:ResourceTag` condition key. To deny the delete actions for AWS App Mesh and AWS Backup if this tag is present, use the `aws:ResourceTag` condition key. For Lambda, use a resource naming convention that includes the `"Confidential"` prefix. Then include a separate statement that prevents deleting resources with that naming convention.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "DenyDeleteSupported",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": [
                "appmesh:DeleteMesh", 
                "backup:DeleteBackupPlan"
                ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:ResourceTag/{{status}}": "{{Confidential}}"
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Sid": "DenyDeleteUnsupported",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": "lambda:DeleteFunction",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:{{*}}:{{123456789012}}:function:{{status-Confidential*}}"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Warning**  
Do not use the …[IfExists](reference_policies_elements_condition_operators.md#Conditions_IfExists) version of the condition operator as a workaround for this finding. This means "Deny the action if the key is present in the request context and the values match. Otherwise, deny the action." In the previous example, including the `lambda:DeleteFunction` action in the `DenyDeleteSupported` statement with the `StringEqualsIfExists` operator always denies the action. For that action, the key is not present in the context, and every attempt to delete that resource type is denied, regardless of whether the resource is tagged.

**Finding details**

In the AWS Management Console, the finding for this check includes the following message:

```
Deny NotAction with unsupported tag condition key for service: Using the effect Deny with NotAction and the tag condition key {{conditionKeyName}} can be overly permissive because some service actions are not denied by this statement.

```

**Resolving the security warning**

Using tag condition keys in the `Condition` element of a policy with the element `NotAction` and `"Effect": "Deny"` can be overly permissive. The condition is ignored for service actions that don’t support the condition key. AWS recommends that you rewrite the logic to deny a list of actions.

If you use the `aws:ResourceTag` condition key with `NotAction`, any new or existing service actions that don’t support the key are not denied. AWS recommends that you explicitly list the actions that you want to deny. IAM Access Analyzer returns a separate finding for listed actions that don’t support the `aws:ResourceTag` condition key. For more information, see [Security Warning – Deny with unsupported tag condition key for service](#access-analyzer-reference-policy-checks-security-warning-deny-with-unsupported-tag-condition-key-for-service). 

When a service supports the `aws:ResourceTag` condition key, you can use tags to control access to that service’s resources. This is known as [attribute-based access control (ABAC)](introduction_attribute-based-access-control.md). Services that don’t support these keys require you to control access to resources using [resource-based access control (RBAC)](introduction_attribute-based-access-control.md#introduction_attribute-based-access-control_compare-rbac).

```

**Resolving the security warning**

You can specify AWS services in the `Principal` element of a resource-based policy using a service principal, which is an identifier for the service. When granting access to a service principal to act on your behalf, restrict access. You can prevent overly permissive policies by using the `aws:SourceArn`, `aws:SourceAccount`, `aws:SourceOrgID`, or `aws:SourceOrgPaths` condition keys to restrict access to a specific source, such as a specific resource ARN, AWS account, organization ID, or organization paths. Restricting access helps you prevent a security issue called *the confused deputy problem*.

**Resolving the security warning**

If you use GitHub as an OIDC IdP, best practice is to limit the entities that can assume the role associated with the IAM IdP. When you include a `Condition` statement in a role trust policy, you can limit the role to a specific GitHub organization, repository, or branch. You can use the condition key `token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub` to limit access. We recommend that you limit the condition to a specific set of repositories or branches. If you do not include this condition, then GitHub Actions from organizations or repositories outside of your control are able to assume roles associated with the GitHub IAM IdP in your AWS account.

To restrict listing to specific prefixes, use one of the following patterns:
+ **Allow with StringLike** – Grant `s3:ListBucket` with a `StringLike` condition on `s3:prefix` listing the prefixes you want to permit. Requests that supply a different prefix are not covered by this Allow and cannot list those objects.
+ **Deny with StringNotLike** – Deny `s3:ListBucket` with a `StringNotLike` condition on `s3:prefix` listing the prefixes you want to allow. A request that omits the prefix or supplies a shorter prefix does not match the allowed set and is denied.

A `Deny` with `StringLike` or an `Allow` with `StringNotLike` does not effectively restrict access because a caller can bypass the condition by specifying a shorter prefix (for example, `priv` instead of `private/`) that does not match the condition value.

```
"findingDetails": "The {{redundantActionCount}} action(s) are redundant because they provide similar permissions. Update the policy to remove the redundant action such as: {{redundantAction}}."
```

**Resolving the suggestion**

When you use wildcards (\*) in the `Action` element, you can include redundant permissions. AWS recommends that you review your policy and include only the permissions that you need. This can help you remove redundant actions.

For example, the following actions include the `iam:GetCredentialReport` action twice.

```
"Action": [
        "iam:Get*",
        "iam:List*",
        "iam:GetCredentialReport"
    ],
```

In this example, permissions are defined for every IAM action that begins with `Get` or `List`. When IAM adds additional get or list operations, this policy will allow them. You might want to allow all of these read-only actions. The `iam:GetCredentialReport` action is already included as part of `iam:Get*`. To remove the duplicate permissions, you could remove `iam:GetCredentialReport`.

You receive a finding for this policy check when all of the contents of an action are redundant. In this example, if the element included `iam:*CredentialReport`, it is not considered redundant. That includes `iam:GetCredentialReport`, which is redundant, and `iam:GenerateCredentialReport`, which is not. Removing either `iam:Get*` or `iam:*CredentialReport` would change the policy's permissions.

```

**Resolving the suggestion**

When you use numeric condition operators for similar values in a condition key, you can create an overlap that results in redundant permissions.

For example, the following `Condition` element includes multiple `aws:MultiFactorAuthAge` conditions that have an age overlap of 1200 seconds.

```
"Condition": {
        "NumericLessThan": {
          "aws:MultiFactorAuthAge": [

            "3600"
          ]
        }
      }
```

In this example, the permissions are defined if multi-factor authentication (MFA) was completed less than 3600 seconds (1 hour) ago. You could remove the redundant `2700` value.

```
"findingDetails": "The {{redundantResourceCount}} resource ARN(s) are redundant because they reference the same resource. Review the use of wildcards (*)"
```

**Resolving the suggestion**

When you use wildcards (\*) in Amazon Resource Names (ARNs), you can create redundant resource permissions.

For example, the following `Resource` element includes multiple ARNs with redundant permissions.

```
"Resource": [
            "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/jane-admin",
            "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/jane-s3only",
            "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/jane*"
        ],
```

In this example, the permissions are defined for any role with a name starting with `jane`. You could remove the redundant `jane-admin` and `jane-s3only` ARNs without changing the resulting permissions. This does make the policy dynamic. It will define permissions for any future roles that begin with `jane`. If the intention of the policy is to allow access to a static number of roles, then remove the last ARN and list only the ARNs that should be defined.

"findingDetails": "Avoid using wildcards (*, ?) in the service name because it might grant unintended access to other AWS services with similar names."
```

**Resolving the suggestion**

When you include the name of an AWS service in a policy, AWS recommends that you do not include wildcards (\*, ?). This might add permissions for future services that you do not intend. For example, there are more than a dozen AWS services with the word `*code*` in their name.

## Suggestion – Allow with unsupported tag condition key for service
<a name="access-analyzer-reference-policy-checks-suggestion-allow-with-unsupported-tag-condition-key-for-service"></a>

**Issue code: **ALLOW\_WITH\_UNSUPPORTED\_TAG\_CONDITION\_KEY\_FOR\_SERVICE

**Finding type: **SUGGESTION

**Finding details**

In the AWS Management Console, the finding for this check includes the following message:

```
Allow with unsupported tag condition key for service: Using the effect Allow with the tag condition key {{conditionKeyName}} and actions for services with the following prefixes does not affect the policy: {{serviceNames}}. Actions for the listed service are not allowed by this statement. We recommend that you move these actions to a different statement without this condition key.
```

In programmatic calls to the AWS CLI or AWS API, the finding for this check includes the following message:

```
"findingDetails": "Using the effect Allow with the tag condition key {{conditionKeyName}} and actions for services with the following prefixes does not affect the policy: {{serviceNames}}. Actions for the listed service are not allowed by this statement. We recommend that you move these actions to a different statement without this condition key."
```

**Resolving the suggestion**

Using unsupported tag condition keys in the `Condition` element of a policy with `"Effect": "Allow"` does not affect the permissions granted by the policy, because the condition is ignored for that service action. AWS recommends that you remove the actions for services that don’t support the condition key and create another statement to allow access to specific resources in that service.

If you use the `aws:ResourceTag` condition key and it’s not supported by a service action, then the key is not included in the request context. In this case, the condition in the `Allow` statement always returns `false` and the action is never allowed. This happens even if the resource is tagged correctly. 

When a service supports the `aws:ResourceTag` condition key, you can use tags to control access to that service’s resources. This is known as [attribute-based access control (ABAC)](introduction_attribute-based-access-control.md). Services that don’t support these keys require you to control access to resources using [resource-based access control (RBAC)](introduction_attribute-based-access-control.md#introduction_attribute-based-access-control_compare-rbac).

**Note**  
Some services allow support for the `aws:ResourceTag` condition key for a subset of their resources and actions. IAM Access Analyzer returns findings for the service actions that are not supported. For example, Amazon S3 supports `aws:ResourceTag` for a subset of its resources. To view all of the resource types available in Amazon S3 that support the `aws:ResourceTag` condition key, see [Resource types defined by Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazons3.html#amazons3-resources-for-iam-policies) in the Service Authorization Reference.

For example, assume that you want to allow team members to view details for specific resources that are tagged with the key-value pair `team=BumbleBee`. Also assume that AWS Lambda allows you to tag resources, but doesn’t support the `aws:ResourceTag` condition key. To allow view actions for AWS App Mesh and AWS Backup if this tag is present, use the `aws:ResourceTag` condition key. For Lambda, use a resource naming convention that includes the team name as a prefix. Then include a separate statement that allows viewing resources with that naming convention.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowViewSupported",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "appmesh:DescribeMesh", 
                "backup:GetBackupPlan"
                ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:ResourceTag/{{team}}": "{{BumbleBee}}"
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowViewUnsupported",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "lambda:GetFunction",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:{{*}}:{{123456789012}}:function:{{team-BumbleBee*}}"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Warning**  
Do not use the `Not` [version of the condition operator](reference_policies_elements_condition_operators.md) with `"Effect": "Allow"` as a workaround for this finding. These condition operators provide negated matching. This means that after the condition is evaluated, the result is negated. In the previous example, including the `lambda:GetFunction` action in the `AllowViewSupported` statement with the `StringNotEquals` operator always allows the action, regardless of whether the resource is tagged.  
Do not use the …[IfExists](reference_policies_elements_condition_operators.md#Conditions_IfExists) version of the condition operator as a workaround for this finding. This means "Allow the action if the key is present in the request context and the values match. Otherwise, allow the action." In the previous example, including the `lambda:GetFunction` action in the `AllowViewSupported` statement with the `StringEqualsIfExists` operator always allows the action. For that action, the key is not present in the context, and every attempt to view that resource type is allowed, regardless of whether the resource is tagged.

**Finding details**

In the AWS Management Console, the finding for this check includes the following message:

```
Allow NotAction with unsupported tag condition key for service: Using the effect Allow with NotAction and the tag condition key {{conditionKeyName}} allows only service actions that support the condition key. The condition key doesn't apply to some service actions. We recommend that you use Action instead of NotAction.
```

In programmatic calls to the AWS CLI or AWS API, the finding for this check includes the following message:

```
"findingDetails": "Using the effect Allow with NotAction and the tag condition key {{conditionKeyName}} allows only service actions that support the condition key. The condition key doesn't apply to some service actions. We recommend that you use Action instead of NotAction."
```

**Resolving the suggestion**

Using unsupported tag condition keys in the `Condition` element of a policy with the element `NotAction` and `"Effect": "Allow"` does not affect the permissions granted by the policy. The condition is ignored for service actions that don’t support the condition key. AWS recommends that you rewrite the logic to allow a list of actions.

If you use the `aws:ResourceTag` condition key with `NotAction`, any new or existing service actions that don’t support the key are not allowed. AWS recommends that you explicitly list the actions that you want to allow. IAM Access Analyzer returns a separate finding for listed actions that don’t support the `aws:ResourceTag` condition key. For more information, see [Suggestion – Allow with unsupported tag condition key for service](#access-analyzer-reference-policy-checks-suggestion-allow-with-unsupported-tag-condition-key-for-service).

When a service supports the `aws:ResourceTag` condition key, you can use tags to control access to that service’s resources. This is known as [attribute-based access control (ABAC)](introduction_attribute-based-access-control.md). Services that don’t support these keys require you to control access to resources using [resource-based access control (RBAC)](introduction_attribute-based-access-control.md#introduction_attribute-based-access-control_compare-rbac).

**Issue code: **RECOMMENDED\_CONDITION\_KEY\_FOR\_SERVICE\_PRINCIPAL

**Finding type: **SUGGESTION

**Finding details**

In the AWS Management Console, the finding for this check includes the following message:

```
Recommended condition key for service principal: To restrict access to the service principal {{servicePrincipalPrefix}} operating on your behalf, we recommend aws:SourceArn, aws:SourceAccount, aws:SourceOrgID, or aws:SourceOrgPaths instead of {{key}}.

In programmatic calls to the AWS CLI or AWS API, the finding for this check includes the following message:

```
"findingDetails": "To restrict access to the service principal {{servicePrincipalPrefix}} operating on your behalf, we recommend aws:SourceArn, aws:SourceAccount, aws:SourceOrgID, or aws:SourceOrgPaths instead of {{key}}."
```

**Resolving the suggestion**

You can specify AWS services in the `Principal` element of a resource-based policy using a *service principal*, which is an identifier for the service. You should use the `aws:SourceArn`, `aws:SourceAccount`, `aws:SourceOrgID`, or `aws:SourceOrgPaths` condition keys when granting access to service principals instead of other condition keys, such as `aws:Referer`. This helps you prevent a security issue called *the confused deputy problem*.

## Suggestion – Irrelevant condition key in policy
<a name="access-analyzer-reference-policy-checks-suggestion-irrelevant-condition-key-in-policy"></a>

**Issue code: **IRRELEVANT\_CONDITION\_KEY\_IN\_POLICY

**Finding type: **SUGGESTION

**Finding details**

In the AWS Management Console, the finding for this check includes the following message:

```
Irrelevant condition key in policy: The condition key {{condition-key}} is not relevant for the {{resource-type}} policy.  Use this key in an identity-based policy to govern access to this resource.

```
"findingDetails": "The condition key {{condition-key}} is not relevant for the {{resource-type}} policy.  Use this key in an identity-based policy to govern access to this resource."
```

**Resolving the suggestion**

Some condition keys aren't relevant for resource-based policies. For example, the `s3:ResourceAccount` condition key isn't relevant for the resource-based policy attached to an Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon S3 access point resource type.

You should use the condition key in an identity-based policy to control access to the resource.

**Issue code: **REDUNDANT\_PRINCIPAL\_IN\_ROLE\_TRUST\_POLICY

**Finding type: **SUGGESTION

**Finding details**

In the AWS Management Console, the finding for this check includes the following message:

```
Redundant principal in role trust policy: The assumed-role principal {{redundant_principal}} is redundant with its parent role {{parent_role}}. Remove the assumed-role principal.

In programmatic calls to the AWS CLI or AWS API, the finding for this check includes the following message:

```
"findingDetails": "The assumed-role principal {{redundant_principal}} is redundant with its parent role {{parent_role}}. Remove the assumed-role principal."
```

**Resolving the suggestion**

If you specify both an assumed-role principal and its parent role in the `Principal` element of a policy, it does not allow or deny any different permissions. For example, it is redundant if you specify the `Principal` element using the following format:

```
"Principal": {
            "AWS": [
            "arn:aws:iam::{{AWS-account-ID}}:role/{{rolename}}",
            "arn:aws:iam::{{AWS-account-ID}}:assumed-role/{{rolename}}/{{rolesessionname}}"
        ]
```

We recommend removing the assumed-role principal.

**Resolving the suggestion**

The `aud` (audience) claim key is a unique identifier for your app that is issued to you when you register your app with the IdP and identifies the recipients that the JSON web token is intended for. Audience claims can be multivalued or single-valued. If the claim is multivalued, use a `ForAllValues` or `ForAnyValue` condition set operator. If the claim is single-valued, do not use a condition set operator.
