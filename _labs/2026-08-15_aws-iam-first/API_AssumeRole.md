# AssumeRole
<a name="API_AssumeRole"></a>

Returns a set of temporary security credentials that you can use to access AWS resources. These temporary credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Typically, you use `AssumeRole` within your account or for cross-account access. For a comparison of `AssumeRole` with other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see [Requesting Temporary Security Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html) and [Compare AWS STS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_sts-comparison.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

 **Permissions** 

The temporary security credentials created by `AssumeRole` can be used to make API calls to any AWS service with the following exception: You cannot call the AWS STS `GetFederationToken` or `GetSessionToken` API operations.

(Optional) You can pass inline or managed session policies to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policy Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to use as managed session policies. The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see [Session Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session) in the *IAM User Guide*.

When you create a role, you create two policies: a role trust policy that specifies *who* can assume the role, and a permissions policy that specifies *what* can be done with the role. You specify the trusted principal that is allowed to assume the role in the role trust policy.

To assume a role from a different account, your AWS account must be trusted by the role. The trust relationship is defined in the role's trust policy when the role is created. That trust policy states which accounts are allowed to delegate that access to users in the account. 

A user who wants to access a role in a different account must also have permissions that are delegated from the account administrator. The administrator must attach a policy that allows the user to call `AssumeRole` for the ARN of the role in the other account.

To allow a user to assume a role in the same account, you can do either of the following:
+ Attach a policy to the user that allows the user to call `AssumeRole` (as long as the role's trust policy trusts the account).
+ Add the user as a principal directly in the role's trust policy.

You can do either because the role’s trust policy acts as an IAM resource-based policy. When a resource-based policy grants access to a principal in the same account, no additional identity-based policy is required. For more information about trust policies and resource-based policies, see [IAM Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

 **Tags** 

(Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These tags are called session tags. For more information about session tags, see [Passing Session Tags in AWS STS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see [Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

You can set the session tags as transitive. Transitive tags persist during role chaining. For more information, see [Chaining Roles with Session Tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html#id_session-tags_role-chaining) in the *IAM User Guide*.

 **Using MFA with AssumeRole** 

(Optional) You can include multi-factor authentication (MFA) information when you call `AssumeRole`. This is useful for cross-account scenarios to ensure that the user that assumes the role has been authenticated with an AWS MFA device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that tests for MFA authentication. If the caller does not include valid MFA information, the request to assume the role is denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA authentication might look like the following example.

 `"Condition": {"Bool": {"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": true}}` 

For more information, see [Configuring MFA-Protected API Access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html) in the *IAM User Guide* guide.

To use MFA with `AssumeRole`, you pass values for the `SerialNumber` and `TokenCode` parameters. The `SerialNumber` value identifies the user's hardware or virtual MFA device. The `TokenCode` is the time-based one-time password (TOTP) that the MFA device produces. 

## Request Parameters
<a name="API_AssumeRole_RequestParameters"></a>

 For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](CommonParameters.md).

 ** DurationSeconds **   
The duration, in seconds, of the role session. The value specified can range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration set for the role. The maximum session duration setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. If you specify a value higher than this setting or the administrator setting (whichever is lower), the operation fails. For example, if you specify a session duration of 12 hours, but your administrator set the maximum session duration to 6 hours, your operation fails.   
Role chaining limits your AWS CLI or AWS API role session to a maximum of one hour. When you use the `AssumeRole` API operation to assume a role, you can specify the duration of your role session with the `DurationSeconds` parameter. You can specify a parameter value of up to 43200 seconds (12 hours), depending on the maximum session duration setting for your role. However, if you assume a role using role chaining and provide a `DurationSeconds` parameter value greater than one hour, the operation fails. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see [Update the maximum session duration for a role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_update-role-settings.html#id_roles_update-session-duration).  
By default, the value is set to `3600` seconds.   
The `DurationSeconds` parameter is separate from the duration of a console session that you might request using the returned credentials. The request to the federation endpoint for a console sign-in token takes a `SessionDuration` parameter that specifies the maximum length of the console session. For more information, see [Creating a URL that Enables Federated Users to Access the AWS Management Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_enable-console-custom-url.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
Type: Integer  
Valid Range: Minimum value of 900. Maximum value of 43200.  
Required: No

 ** ExternalId **   
A unique identifier that might be required when you assume a role in another account. If the administrator of the account to which the role belongs provided you with an external ID, then provide that value in the `ExternalId` parameter. This value can be any string, such as a passphrase or account number. A cross-account role is usually set up to trust everyone in an account. Therefore, the administrator of the trusting account might send an external ID to the administrator of the trusted account. That way, only someone with the ID can assume the role, rather than everyone in the account. For more information about the external ID, see [How to Use an External ID When Granting Access to Your AWS Resources to a Third Party](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.  
The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: \+=,.@:\\/-  
Type: String  
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 2. Maximum length of 1224.  
Pattern: `[\w+=,.@:\/-]*`   
Required: No

 ** Policy **   
An IAM policy in JSON format that you want to use as an inline session policy.  
This parameter is optional. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see [Session Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session) in the *IAM User Guide*.  
The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. The JSON policy characters can be any ASCII character from the space character to the end of the valid character list (\\u0020 through \\u00FF). It can also include the tab (\\u0009), linefeed (\\u000A), and carriage return (\\u000D) characters.  
An AWS conversion compresses the passed inline session policy, managed policy ARNs, and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. Your request can fail for this limit even if your plaintext meets the other requirements. The `PackedPolicySize` response element indicates by percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the upper size limit.
For more information about role session permissions, see [Session policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session).  
Type: String  
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1.  
Pattern: `[\u0009\u000A\u000D\u0020-\u00FF]+`   
Required: No

 **PolicyArns.member.N**   
The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the IAM managed policies that you want to use as managed session policies. The policies must exist in the same account as the role.  
This parameter is optional. You can provide up to 10 managed policy ARNs. However, the plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. For more information about ARNs, see [Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) in the AWS General Reference.  
An AWS conversion compresses the passed inline session policy, managed policy ARNs, and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. Your request can fail for this limit even if your plaintext meets the other requirements. The `PackedPolicySize` response element indicates by percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the upper size limit.
Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see [Session Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session) in the *IAM User Guide*.  
Type: Array of [PolicyDescriptorType](API_PolicyDescriptorType.md) objects  
Required: No

 **ProvidedContexts.member.N**   
A list of previously acquired trusted context assertions in the format of a JSON array. The trusted context assertion is signed and encrypted by AWS STS.  
The following is an example of a `ProvidedContext` value that includes a single trusted context assertion and the ARN of the context provider from which the trusted context assertion was generated.  
 `[{"ProviderArn":"arn:aws:iam::aws:contextProvider/IdentityCenter","ContextAssertion":"trusted-context-assertion"}]`   
Type: Array of [ProvidedContext](API_ProvidedContext.md) objects  
Array Members: Minimum number of 1 item. Maximum number of 5 items.  
Required: No

 ** RoleArn **   
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role to assume.  
Type: String  
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 20. Maximum length of 2048.  
Pattern: `[\u0009\u000A\u000D\u0020-\u007E\u0085\u00A0-\uD7FF\uE000-\uFFFD\u10000-\u10FFFF]+`   
Required: Yes

 ** RoleSessionName **   
An identifier for the assumed role session.  
Use the role session name to uniquely identify a session when the same role is assumed by different principals or for different reasons. In cross-account scenarios, the role session name is visible to, and can be logged by the account that owns the role. The role session name is also used in the ARN of the assumed role principal. This means that subsequent cross-account API requests that use the temporary security credentials will expose the role session name to the external account in their AWS CloudTrail logs.  
For security purposes, administrators can view this field in [AWS CloudTrail logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/cloudtrail-integration.html#cloudtrail-integration_signin-tempcreds) to help identify who performed an action in AWS. Your administrator might require that you specify your user name as the session name when you assume the role. For more information, see [`sts:RoleSessionName`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_iam-condition-keys.html#ck_rolesessionname).  
The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: \+=,.@-  
Type: String  
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 2. Maximum length of 64.  
Pattern: `[\w+=,.@-]*`   
Required: Yes

 ** SerialNumber **   
The identification number of the MFA device that is associated with the user who is making the `AssumeRole` call. Specify this value if the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that requires MFA authentication. The value is either the serial number for a hardware device (such as `GAHT12345678`) or an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a virtual device (such as `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/user`).  
The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: \+=/:,.@-  
Type: String  
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 9. Maximum length of 256.  
Pattern: `[\w+=/:,.@-]*`   
Required: No

 ** SourceIdentity **   
The source identity specified by the principal that is calling the `AssumeRole` operation. The source identity value persists across [chained role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html#iam-term-role-chaining) sessions.  
You can require users to specify a source identity when they assume a role. You do this by using the [`sts:SourceIdentity`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-sourceidentity) condition key in a role trust policy. You can use source identity information in AWS CloudTrail logs to determine who took actions with a role. You can use the `aws:SourceIdentity` condition key to further control access to AWS resources based on the value of source identity. For more information about using source identity, see [Monitor and control actions taken with assumed roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_control-access_monitor.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.  
The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: \+=,.@-. You cannot use a value that begins with the text `aws:`. This prefix is reserved for AWS internal use.  
Type: String  
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 2. Maximum length of 64.  
Pattern: `[\w+=,.@-]*`   
Required: No

 **Tags.member.N**   
A list of session tags that you want to pass. Each session tag consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information about session tags, see [Tagging AWS STS Sessions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.  
This parameter is optional. You can pass up to 50 session tags. The plaintext session tag keys can’t exceed 128 characters, and the values can’t exceed 256 characters. For these and additional limits, see [IAM and AWS STS Character Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-limits.html#reference_iam-limits-entity-length) in the *IAM User Guide*.  
An AWS conversion compresses the passed inline session policy, managed policy ARNs, and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. Your request can fail for this limit even if your plaintext meets the other requirements. The `PackedPolicySize` response element indicates by percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the upper size limit.
You can pass a session tag with the same key as a tag that is already attached to the role. When you do, session tags override a role tag with the same key.   
Tag key–value pairs are not case sensitive, but case is preserved. This means that you cannot have separate `Department` and `department` tag keys. Assume that the role has the `Department`=`Marketing` tag and you pass the `department`=`engineering` session tag. `Department` and `department` are not saved as separate tags, and the session tag passed in the request takes precedence over the role tag.  
Additionally, if you used temporary credentials to perform this operation, the new session inherits any transitive session tags from the calling session. If you pass a session tag with the same key as an inherited tag, the operation fails. To view the inherited tags for a session, see the AWS CloudTrail logs. For more information, see [Viewing Session Tags in CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html#id_session-tags_ctlogs) in the *IAM User Guide*.  
Type: Array of [Tag](API_Tag.md) objects  
Array Members: Maximum number of 50 items.  
Required: No

 ** TokenCode **   
The value provided by the MFA device, if the trust policy of the role being assumed requires MFA. (In other words, if the policy includes a condition that tests for MFA). If the role being assumed requires MFA and if the `TokenCode` value is missing or expired, the `AssumeRole` call returns an "access denied" error.  
The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is a sequence of six numeric digits.  
Type: String  
Length Constraints: Fixed length of 6.  
Pattern: `[\d]*`   
Required: No

 **TransitiveTagKeys.member.N**   
A list of keys for session tags that you want to set as transitive. If you set a tag key as transitive, the corresponding key and value passes to subsequent sessions in a role chain. For more information, see [Chaining Roles with Session Tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html#id_session-tags_role-chaining) in the *IAM User Guide*.  
This parameter is optional. The transitive status of a session tag does not impact its packed binary size.  
If you choose not to specify a transitive tag key, then no tags are passed from this session to any subsequent sessions.  
Type: Array of strings  
Array Members: Maximum number of 50 items.  
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 128.  
Pattern: `[\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]+`   
Required: No

## Response Elements
<a name="API_AssumeRole_ResponseElements"></a>

The following elements are returned by the service.

 ** AssumedRoleUser **   
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and the assumed role ID, which are identifiers that you can use to refer to the resulting temporary security credentials. For example, you can reference these credentials as a principal in a resource-based policy by using the ARN or assumed role ID. The ARN and ID include the `RoleSessionName` that you specified when you called `AssumeRole`.   
Type: [AssumedRoleUser](API_AssumedRoleUser.md) object

 ** Credentials **   
The temporary security credentials, which include an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security (or session) token.  
The size of the security token that AWS STS API operations return is not fixed. We strongly recommend that you make no assumptions about the maximum size.
Type: [Credentials](API_Credentials.md) object

 ** PackedPolicySize **   
A percentage value that indicates the packed size of the session policies and session tags combined passed in the request. The request fails if the packed size is greater than 100 percent, which means the policies and tags exceeded the allowed space.  
Type: Integer  
Valid Range: Minimum value of 0.

 ** SourceIdentity **   
The source identity specified by the principal that is calling the `AssumeRole` operation.  
You can require users to specify a source identity when they assume a role. You do this by using the `sts:SourceIdentity` condition key in a role trust policy. You can use source identity information in AWS CloudTrail logs to determine who took actions with a role. You can use the `aws:SourceIdentity` condition key to further control access to AWS resources based on the value of source identity. For more information about using source identity, see [Monitor and control actions taken with assumed roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_control-access_monitor.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.  
The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: =,.@-  
Type: String  
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 2. Maximum length of 64.  
Pattern: `[\w+=,.@-]*` 

## Errors
<a name="API_AssumeRole_Errors"></a>

For information about the errors that are common to all actions, see [Common Error Types](CommonErrors.md).

 ** ExpiredToken **   
The web identity token that was passed is expired or is not valid. Get a new identity token from the identity provider and then retry the request.  
HTTP Status Code: 400

 ** MalformedPolicyDocument **   
The request was rejected because the policy document was malformed. The error message describes the specific error.  
HTTP Status Code: 400

 ** PackedPolicyTooLarge **   
The request was rejected because the total packed size of the session policies and session tags combined was too large. An AWS conversion compresses the session policy document, session policy ARNs, and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. The error message indicates by percentage how close the policies and tags are to the upper size limit. For more information, see [Passing Session Tags in AWS STS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.  
You could receive this error even though you meet other defined session policy and session tag limits. For more information, see [IAM and AWS STS Entity Character Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html#reference_iam-limits-entity-length) in the *IAM User Guide*.  
HTTP Status Code: 400

 ** RegionDisabled **   
 AWS STS is not activated in the requested region for the account that is being asked to generate credentials. The account administrator must use the IAM console to activate AWS STS in that region. For more information, see [Activating and Deactivating AWS STS in an AWS Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html#sts-regions-activate-deactivate) in the *IAM User Guide*.  
HTTP Status Code: 403
